## Code Directory Structure

* The project repository structure is organized as an installable single package called `project_starter`
* `project_starter` python files are packaged in the `project_starter/project_starter` directory. 
* All other miscellaneous files like `docs`, `config.yaml`, `.gitignore` etc. are in the **root**  directory which is not a package.
